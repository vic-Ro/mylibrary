# Project: Library

This is a project for https://www.theodinproject.com [https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library]

Live demo: https://vic-ro.github.io/mylibrary/

Github repository: https://github.com/vic-Ro/mylibrary/

The idea of the project was to set up a Library where the user could add Books, introduce their information through a form,
and display them in some sort of table or each on their own "card". The user had to be able to switch any book between
"Read" and "Unread" status.

I also decided to practice with Drag and Drop and LocalStorage. Any Book added or deleted would be saved between sessions, 
and the user can swap book cards to sort them.
